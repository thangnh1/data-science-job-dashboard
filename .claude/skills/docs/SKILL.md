  Use when a user-facing feature is completed or changed, the onboarding flow is updated,
  API endpoints are added that affect user experience, documentation appears outdated or
  missing, or when preparing a release and docs need to be current.

## Working Protocol

When updating documentation after a feature change:

1. **Understand what was built**: Read the actual implementation using Read/Grep. Never document what something "should" do — only what it actually does.
2. **Check if a user guide section exists**: Search `USER_GUIDE.md` for an existing section on this feature. Update it if so; add a new section if not.
3. **Classify the content type** (Diátaxis framework — see below): is this a tutorial, how-to guide, reference, or explanation? Write accordingly.
4. **Write from the user's perspective**: Describe what the user does and what they see. Not how the system works internally.
5. **Use imperative mood**: "Click Save" not "The Save button can be clicked". "Enter your email" not "An email field is provided".
6. **Verify accuracy**: After writing, re-read the implementation or trace the code path to confirm every claim is accurate.

## Diátaxis Documentation Framework

Every piece of documentation belongs to exactly one of these four types. Write each type differently:

| Type | Orientation | User's state | Analogy |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Tutorial** | Learning-oriented | "I want to learn" | Teaching a child to cook |
| **How-to guide** | Task-oriented | "I want to do X" | A recipe |
| **Reference** | Information-oriented | "I need to check a fact" | A dictionary |
| **Explanation** | Understanding-oriented | "I want to understand why" | An essay |

**Tutorial** (USER_GUIDE.md "Getting Started" section): lead the user through a complete, meaningful task. Success matters more than covering every option. Do not explain why — do that in Explanation.

**How-to guide** (USER_GUIDE.md feature sections): assume the user knows the basics. Focus on steps to accomplish a specific goal. State the goal in the title: "How to reset your password", not "Password reset".

**Reference** (API.md, DATABASE.md): complete, accurate, consistent. No narrative. Describe what it is, not how to use it.

**Explanation** (ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md): explore context, background, trade-offs. Answer "why" and "how does this work". No procedural steps.

The most common mistake: writing tutorials that are actually how-to guides, or how-to guides that are actually references. Keep them distinct.

## Conciseness Discipline

Living docs describe current state only. Every update pass is also a pruning pass.

- **Rewrite, do not append**: when updating a section, rewrite it to reflect current state. Do not add change notes, inline version annotations, or "as of X" qualifiers alongside old content.
- **No version annotations in guides**: remove `Changed in vX.Y`, `As of version...`, and similar markers from `USER_GUIDE.md` and `README.md`. These belong in `CHANGELOG.md` exclusively.
- **Remove completed migration guides**: once a deprecated feature has been fully removed and no active users need to migrate, delete its migration section entirely.
- **Prune redundant context**: after every update, re-read the surrounding paragraphs. If any content is now redundant, contradicted, or no longer relevant, delete it.
- **Each section reads as written today**: the goal is documentation that has no visible edit history — as if written fresh for the current version.

## Writing Quality Checklist

Apply to every piece of content before considering it done:

- [ ] **One idea per sentence** — if a sentence has more than one clause, consider splitting it
- [ ] **Active voice** — "Click Save" not "Save should be clicked"; "The system sends an email" not "An email is sent"
- [ ] **Specific over vague** — "within 5 minutes" not "shortly"; "click the blue Save button" not "proceed"
- [ ] **Numbered steps for procedures** — never bullet points for sequences; bullets imply unordered
- [ ] **Plain language** — aim for Flesch-Kincaid grade 8 or below for user-facing content; no jargon without definition
- [ ] **Scannable headers** — a user should be able to skim headers and know where to go; "How to update your billing address" beats "Billing"
- [ ] **Accuracy verified** — every claim traced to the code or a live test

## USER_GUIDE.md Writing Standards

**Voice and tone**:
- Write for non-technical users unless the product is explicitly developer-facing
- Short sentences. Active voice. No jargon.
- Explain acronyms on first use. Never assume familiarity with technical terms.

**Structure for each feature section**:
```markdown
### [Feature Name]

[One-sentence description: what this feature does and why a user would want it.]

#### How to [specific task]

1. [Step 1 — specific and actionable: "Click the Settings icon in the top-right corner"]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

**What to expect**: [Describe the visible outcome — what the user sees, hears, or receives]

#### Common Issues

**[Exact error message or problem description]**
[Why it happens and precisely how to fix it. Never "contact support" as the first suggestion.]
```

**Screenshots**: note `[screenshot: description]` as a placeholder where a screenshot would help. Do not embed actual images — flag to the human to supply them.

## Changelog Discipline

When a feature is added, changed, or removed, add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (create it at the project root if it does not exist). Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- [New feature that was added]

### Changed
- [Existing feature that was changed in a backwards-compatible way]

### Deprecated
- [Feature that will be removed in a future version]

### Removed
- [Feature that was removed]

### Fixed
- [Bug that was fixed]

### Security
- [Vulnerability that was fixed]
```

Rules: latest version at the top; each version has a date (`## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-25`); `[Unreleased]` section collects changes until a version is tagged.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Documentation drift**: writing from memory or the PRD rather than the actual code; creates docs that describe what the feature was supposed to do, not what it does
- **Future tense for unbuilt features**: "This will allow users to..." — only document what exists today
- **Orphaned docs for removed features**: when a feature is removed, remove or archive its docs; outdated docs are actively harmful
- **Jargon without definitions**: "the webhook payload is POSTed to your endpoint" — not everyone knows what a webhook or POST means
- **Passive voice that hides the actor**: "the form is submitted" — who submits it? The user? The system?
- **Burying the most important step**: lead with what the user needs to know first
- **Historical reference accumulation**: adding "Changed in X.Y", migration notes, or "previously this worked by..." paragraphs to living docs. `USER_GUIDE.md` and `README.md` describe current state only. History belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`.
