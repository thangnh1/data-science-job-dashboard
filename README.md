# Claude Development Template

![Claude Development Template](.assets/cover.png)

A bootstrapping template for software projects built with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code). Use it as a GitHub template, say **"START!"**, and Claude walks you through setting up all the documentation before a single line of code is written.

---

## What This Is

This repository is an opinionated project scaffold that gives Claude everything it needs to act as a coherent development team from day one:

- **Specialized agents** for each discipline (architecture, frontend, backend, design, database, QA, docs)
- **Living documentation** that agents keep up to date as the project evolves
- **Git conventions** enforced through commit format, branch naming, and PR templates
- **A product requirements document** that serves as the authoritative source of truth — protected from accidental edits
- **A backlog** agents can reference when you ask "what should we work on next?"

---

## How to Use

### 1. Create a new repository from this template

Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"** on GitHub.

Or with the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo create my-project --template <this-repo> --private --clone && cd my-project
```

### 2. Open it in Claude Code and say "START!"

Claude will read `START_HERE.md` and begin the onboarding sequence — asking questions about your project and filling in all the documentation placeholders automatically.

### 3. Start building

Once onboarding is complete, `START_HERE.md` is deleted and the project is ready. Use `TODO.md` to see what to work on first.

## Agents

Each agent is a specialist Claude sub-agent with a defined role, document ownership, and working protocol.

| Agent | Model | Responsibility | Owns |
|-------|-------|----------------|------|
| `project-manager` | Sonnet | Backlog governance, sprint planning, agent coordination | `TODO.md` |
| `systems-architect` | Opus | High-level design, tech decisions, ADRs | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISIONS.md` |
| `frontend-developer` | Sonnet | UI components, pages, client-side logic | Frontend section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `backend-developer` | Sonnet | API endpoints, business logic, integrations | `API.md` |
| `ui-ux-designer` | Sonnet | UX flows, design system, accessibility specs | Design System section of `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `database-expert` | Sonnet | Schema design, migrations, query optimization | `DATABASE.md` |
| `qa-engineer` | Sonnet | Playwright E2E tests, test strategy | `tests/e2e/` |
| `documentation-writer` | Haiku | User guide, README updates | `USER_GUIDE.md` |

Claude selects agents automatically based on context, or you can invoke them directly.

## Key Conventions

**Commits** — [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login with Google
fix(api): handle null response from payment provider
```

**Branches**:
```
feature/<ticket-id>-short-description
fix/<ticket-id>-short-description
```

**PRD is read-only** — `PRD.md` is protected by a three-layer mechanism (warning block, CLAUDE.md rule, and agent system prompts). Agents will refuse to modify it without explicit human instruction.

**Documentation stays current** — Agents are required to update the relevant `docs/` file before marking any implementation task complete.

---

## Design Principles

- **Design before code** — the Systems Architect agent produces specs and ADRs; specialists implement
- **Document ownership** — every `docs/` file has a declared owner agent; others don't overwrite
- **Append-only ADRs** — architectural decisions are never silently revised; a new ADR supersedes an old one
- **Tests map to requirements** — QA writes tests against FR-XXX items in the PRD, not implementation details
- **TODO.md is human territory** — agents read the backlog to suggest work; they never auto-modify it
